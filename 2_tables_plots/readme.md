# Python for tabular data analysis

In this part of the training, we will show how Python and the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) package can be used to analyze structured (tabular) data. 

We'll also make use of generative AI, i.e. to assist us with the generation of data and code.

## Use Cases for Tabular Data Analysis

Tabular data analysis is a fundamental task across various research fields, not limited to computer science and machine learning. Here are some examples of how different fields use tabular data analysis:

* **Social Sciences**: Researchers analyze survey data, demographic statistics, and social trends to study human behavior, societal changes, and policy impacts.
* **Healthcare and Medicine**: Medical researchers examine patient records, clinical trial results, and public health data to identify disease patterns, treatment outcomes, and healthcare efficiencies.
* **Finance and Economics**: Economists and financial analysts explore economic indicators, stock market data, and financial transactions to understand economic trends, forecast market movements, and make investment decisions.
* **Environmental Science**: Environmental researchers analyze climate data, pollution levels, and biodiversity metrics to study environmental changes, assess ecological impacts, and develop conservation strategies.
* **Education**: Educators and academic researchers examine student performance data, educational outcomes, and institutional statistics to improve teaching methods, curriculum design, and educational policies.

### The Need for Convenient Tools

Analyzing tabular data can be complex and time-consuming. Researchers need efficient and convenient tools to:

* Clean and preprocess data
* Perform statistical analyses 
* Visualize data trends and patterns 
* Handle large datasets efficiently 
* Collaborate and share findings

## What is Pandas?

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) is a powerful, open-source Python library designed for tabular data manipulation and analysis.
It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly and intuitively.

Pandas offers a wide range of features that simplify tabular data analysis:

* **Data Structures**: Pandas introduces two main data structures: Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional). These structures make it easy to store, manipulate, and analyze data.
* **Data Cleaning**: Pandas provides functions to handle missing data, duplicate entries, and data type conversions, ensuring your dataset is ready for analysis.
* **Data Manipulation**: You can easily filter, sort, and aggregate data to derive meaningful insights.
* **Statistical Analysis**: Perform descriptive statistics and more complex analyses with built-in methods.
* **Data Visualization**: Pandas integrates with visualization libraries like Matplotlib and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to create informative charts and plots.

By using Pandas, researchers across various fields can streamline their data analysis workflows, gain deeper insights from their data, and make data-driven decisions more effectively.

## Code generation and data analysis with AI

### How Generative AI Can Help Beginners

Generative AI, including chatbots like ChatGPT, can be an invaluable resource in data analysis. Here are several ways generative AI can assist:

* **Generating Jupyter Notebooks**: AI can help create ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks tailored to specific data analysis tasks. These notebooks can include code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, allowing beginners to understand and modify the code as needed.
* **Code Examples and Explanations**: AI can provide examples and explanations for various data analysis techniques, helping beginners learn how to implement and customize different methods using pandas.
* **Step-by-Step Guidance**: AI can offer step-by-step instructions for complex tasks, breaking down the process into manageable steps and ensuring beginners understand each part of the analysis.

### Considerations for Using AI-Generated Code

While generative AI can be beneficial, there are several important considerations to keep in mind regarding the generated code:

* **Accuracy and Relevance**: Ensure that the generated code is accurate and relevant to your specific dataset and analysis goals. Review and test the code thoroughly before using it in your projects.
* **Understanding the Code**: Beginners should strive to understand the code generated by AI. This understanding will help them learn the underlying concepts and enable them to modify and extend the code for their specific needs.
* **Data Privacy and Security**: Be cautious about sharing sensitive data with AI tools. Ensure that any data used in the analysis is anonymized and secure.
* **Quality Control**: AI-generated code may not always follow best practices. Review the code for readability, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards.
* **Continuous Learning**: Use AI as a learning tool rather than a crutch. Continuously seek to improve your knowledge and skills in data analysis and Python programming.
