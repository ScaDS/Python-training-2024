# Programming a chat bot

As exercise, we use [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) and [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) to build a basic chatbot.
You can run it by executing this code from the terminal:

```
voila gui.ipynb
```

And this user-interface will open:

## Exercise

In its predefined configuration, it is a bit rude. 
Update the code in [`gui.ipynb`](gui.ipynb) to make it more kind and teach it specific knowledge you think the chatbot should be aware of.
